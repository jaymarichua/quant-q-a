<h6>Recurrence relation</h6>

In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation according to which the $n$th term of a sequence of numbers is equal to some combination of the previous terms. 

<h6>Fibonacci</h6>

In linear recurrences, the $n$th term is equated to a linear function of the $k$ previous terms. A famous example is the recurrence for Fibonacci numbers,

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

where the order $k$ is two and the linear function merely adds the two previous terms. The example is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients
