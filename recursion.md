<h5>Recurrence relation</h5>

In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation according to which the $n$th term of a sequence of numbers is equal to some combination of the previous terms.

In linear recurrences, the $n$th term is equated to a linear function of the $k$ previous terms. A famous example is the recurrence for Fibonacci numbers,

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

where the order $k$ is two and the linear function merely adds the two previous terms. The example is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients

Difference equations often arise in probability, especially when applying the law of total probability. In this section, we will show how to solve difference equations of the form

$$p_i = p \cdot p_{i+1} + q \cdot p_{i-1}$$

where p != 0 and q = 1-p. (This equation comes up in the gambler's ruin problem.)
