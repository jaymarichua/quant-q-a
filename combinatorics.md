<h5>Combinatorics</h5>

<h6>Rule of Product</h6>

If there are $m$ ways to arrange something, and then $n$ ways to arrange something else after that, then the number of ways to arrange both of those things is $m×n$.

<h6>Rule of Sum</h6>h6

If there are $m$ ways to arrange somthing, and there are $n$ ways to arrange something else, and these arrangements cannot both happen, then the number of to arrange both of those things is $m×n$.
