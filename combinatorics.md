<h5>Combinatorics</h5>
The topic of combinatorics in word problems involves figuring ways of counting large number of outcomes, i.e. possibilities in relating to probability and statistics.

<h6>Rule of Product</h6>

If there are $m$ ways to arrange something, and then $n$ ways to arrange something else after that, then the number of ways to arrange both of those things is $m×n$.

<h6>Rule of Sum</h6>

If there are $m$ ways to arrange somthing, and there are $n$ ways to arrange something else, and these arrangements cannot both happen, then the number of to arrange both of those things is $m×n$.

The utility of both rules are extended by other principles to solve harder problems, such as using subtraction in the case of double counting, which can be generalized with the principle of inclusion and exclusion.
