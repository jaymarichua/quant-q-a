<h6>Tips & Tricks for the Optiver Sequences Test:</h6>

For beginners in sequence solving, the first step is understanding the basic types of numerical sequences. It's important to note that in tests like the Optiver Sequence test, you'll often encounter complex combinations of what are in essence basic sequence types. Here's a list of the basics to help you start:

*Arithmetic Sequences*: Characterized by a constant difference between consecutive terms. For example, in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8..., each number increases by 2. Identifying this constant difference is crucial for predicting subsequent numbers. However, this difference itself can sometimes be part of a secondary sequence, adding a layer of complexity in identifying subsequent numbers.

*Geometric Sequences*: In these, each term results from multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. An example is 2, 4, 8, 16..., where each term is twice the previous one. Recognizing this multiplication factor is key in geometric sequences. In more complex scenarios, the multiplication factor may also vary according to another underlying sequence.

*Fibonacci Sequences*: Famous for each number being the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1, like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... The additive pattern is vital for identifying the next numbers in Fibonacci sequences.

*Double Sequences*: These involve two separate, interwoven or alternating sequences. Understanding the pattern of each sequence and how they interact is essential for solving double sequence problems.

During practice, you'll learn that the Optiver Sequence Test presents these types in various complex combinations, creating more challenging problems. Engaging in consistent practice with different types of sequences is the key to effective preparation.

<h6>Sequences</h6>

1. Take the difference between each next number in the sequence. 
2. Notice a pattern for an arithmetic operation in the difference sequence which could be a constant factor, exponentiation, primes, fibonacci sequence, factorials, or mod.

Fraction Sequence: notice the numerator and denominator
Pairs, Alternating, Fibonacci seed, etc. 

<h6>Examples</h6>

$$6, 8, 11, 16, 23, 34, 47, ...$$

The sequence starts with the number 6 and continues by adding consecutive prime numbers starting from the prime number 2. The correct answer is found by adding the next prime number in the sequence (17) to the last displayed number in the sequence (47), which equals 64.

$$10, 29, 54, 85, 122, 165, ...$$

This sequence starts with the number 10. It then increases by an amount that itself increases by a constant value each step. The initial change is 19 and it increases by 6 each time. The correct answer is the next value in the sequence which is 214.

<h6>Particularly Commonly Occuring Cases</h6>

```
Alternating pattern mentioned above as double sequences
Fibonacci pattern masked in an alternating pattern mentioned above as double sequences
+1, +2, +1, +2, +1, ...
x5, x4, x3, x2, x1, ... 
```

<h6>Generalized Approach</h6>

```
Arithmetic: The sequence lends itself to a solution through a linearly increasing trend 
Geometric: The sequence lends itself to a solution through a scaling trend
Prime Numbers: The sequence lends itself to a solution through noticing that the numbers are odd and memorizing the prime number sequence
Fibonacci: Remember that in a Fibonacci sequence, the first two digits are only seed
Mixed-up Fibonacci: The last resort for the quiz master to create confusing sequences as the other ones can easily be deciphered
Divisibility Rules: Divisibility rules can also lend to the answer among the multiple choice options
