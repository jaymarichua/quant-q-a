<h6>Sequences</h6>

1. Take the difference between each next number in the sequence. 
2. Notice a pattern for an arithmetic operation in the difference sequence which could be a constant factor, exponentiation, primes, fibonacci sequence, factorials, or mod.

<h6>Examples</h6>

$$6, 8, 11, 16, 23, 34, 47, ...$$

The sequence starts with the number 6 and continues by adding consecutive prime numbers starting from the prime number 2. The correct answer is found by adding the next prime unmber in the sequence (17) to the last displayed number in the sequence (47), which equals 64.

$$10, 29, 54, 85, 122, 165$$

This sequence starts with the number 10. It then increases by an amount that itself increases by a constant value each step. The initial change is 19 and it increases by 6 each time. The correct answer is the next value in the sequence which is 214.
