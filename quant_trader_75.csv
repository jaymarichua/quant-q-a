Combinatorics, Circular Charlie, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, Probability is a ratio of x:y. This is a problem that can be solved by using combination to count x ({n-2}C10) and count y (distribute into bins 14C10).
Combinatorics, Colorful Cube, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, There are 8 vertices on a cube and also a cube has 6 sides. The question prompts counting all the ways the sides can be fixed y (6! sides) and x (8 vertices x 3! ways of arranging fixed sides x 3! ways of arranging the other remaining sides).
Combinatorics, Modified Deck Pair, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, Count the ways you can get a pair (9 suites x 4C2 or picking the already matching suite +1) and divide that by drawing k cards from all the number of ways the remaining cards (38C2) can be arranged.
Combinatorics, Unfriendly, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, The easiest way to compute this is to calculate the total number of ways to invite people (8C5) and then subtracting those that invite both (6C3).
Combinatorics, 2D Paths II, Medium, Solved, 2024-01-25, Gridwalk. Let P_1 and P_2 be the events that your character through (2.3) and (4.6) and then use inclusion-exclusion for double counting.
Combinatorics, 9 Sum II, Medium, Solved, 2024-01-26, A classic problem in probability. Represent the number in terms of its digits: x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n. Since x_1 cannot be zero then represent with x'_1 + ... x_n = 9-1 where the solution becomes (9+ndigits-1)C(ndigits-1).
Conditional Probability, Baby Boy, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-27, Conditional probability introduces conditional EV. Simple application of Bayes' theorem and noticing the unkown term cancels out after writing down the equation.
Conditional Probability, Conditional Double Heads, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-27, Bayes' theorem application and setting-up the equation as p_n > 19/20 and p_n = (1/20)/(1/20 + 19/(20*2^n)).
Conditional Probability, Matching Die Pair, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-27, There are two cases to consider. When the dice values are the same 1/36 x 1/6 and (+) are different 1/36 x 5/6 x 2 (since dies are non-distict i.e. ab or ba look the same).
Conditional Probability, Red Blue Equality, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-27, Solve for x after setting up the equation from drawing the first item 3/(x+3) and second item 2/(x+2).  
Conditional Probability, Better in Red III, Medium, Solved, 2024-01-27, Bayes' theorem application with counting and (brainteaser) considering that the particular cube in the middle will not have a side repainted to red.
Conditional Probability, Rainbow Selection, Medium, Solved, 2024-01-27, Solve for x after setting up the equation without replacement.
Conditional EV, 3 Heads 3 Tails I, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-27, Symmetry.
