Combinatorics, Circular Charlie, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, Probability is a ratio of x:y. This is a problem that can be solved by using combination to count x and count y (distribute into bins 14C10) and in a circle two bins are removed ({n-2}C10)
Combinatorics, Colorful Cube, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, The easiest way to compute this is to calculate the total number of ways to invite people (8C5) and then subtracting those that invite both (6C3).
Combinatorics, Modified Deck Pair, Easy, Solved, 2024-01-24, Count the ways you can get a pair (9 suites x 4C2 or picking the already matching suite +1) and divide that by drawing k cards from all the number of ways the remaining cards (38C2) can be arranged.
