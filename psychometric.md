Psychometric tests can be practiced for; here are a few pieces of information on these types of tests that may be encountered in a quant interview.

<h6>Time management and Multi-tasking</h6>

Tracking the queue and remembering that the tasks will be needing attention at a certain time in the future; similar to the games Overcooked and Diner Dash. 5 minutes.

<h6>Risk management and Price discovery</h6>

Understanding the importance of price discovery as risks can only be managed through decisions that are informed by this initial price discovery strategy. In theory, the first few balloons can be popped for price averaging, but in practice, taking profits early also creates a position for future risk taking. An advantage can be gained by having a more efficient method about the price discovery, by making assumptions with the range of the values that a search algorithm can be used. Similar psychometric tests are available from quant sites such as OpenQuant. 20 minutes.
