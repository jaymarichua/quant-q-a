<h5>Conditional Probability</h5>

Quick mathematics questions in probability mainly involve Bayes' theorem and Expected Value (EV).

<h6>Bayes' theorem (2nd form)</h6>

$$P_E(H) = P(H)P_H(E) / [P(H)P_H(E) + P(~H)P_{~H}(E)]$$

<h6>Expected Utility</h6>

$$EU(A)=\sum_{oâˆˆO} P_A(o)U(o)$$

<h6>Bayes' Theorem and Machine Learning</h6>

Many modern machine learning techniques rely on Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update beliefs upon discovery of new information.
